        Calculate area of Pizza Slice (triangle)

        According to Guinness, the largest circular pizza ever baked weighed was made in Norwood, South Africa by
        Norwood Hypermarket on December 8, 1990. It weighed 26,883 pounds. The pizza measured 122 feet, 8 inches
        in diameter, weighed 26,883 pounds, and contained 9,920 pounds of flour, 3,960 pounds of cheese, 1,763
        pounds of mushrooms, 1,984 pounds of tomato purée, and 1,984 pounds of chopped tomatoes.

        Write the following program using JavaScript:

            1. Input: Prompt user to enter base length
            2. Input: Prompt user to enter height length
            3. Calculate: compute the area
            4. Output: Display base and height from the user to console in a template using interpolation
            5. Output: Display calculated area to the DOM in a template using interpolation

        Given:
            • Area of a triangle = (base * height) / 2
